They went toe-to-toe in the 3rd row for this flow
Sweat dripping down Swayze, the sickness violent like Scorsese
With no options to catch the torrent but an absorbent garment
He hunched over and lost his composure in this Hyundai enclosure
With every heave received a ho wanted to leave the scene
The smell terrible, that blue sweater soaked and now unwearable
We're trapped here holding on to hope of a new year
With 40 starting strong, the sweater laid bare in grass near
41 a distant horizon so until then its RIP Cashmere
